# Etta
## A Simple iOS Etymology App

Etta is a native client for the incredible etymonline.com website.

Due to iOS 10's restrictions on http connections, the app needs a server component to access the (non-encrypted) etymonline.com website and to provide a stable API for the app to access.

This is an opportunity to work on developing some server side swift as well, which will exist in a different repo, located ____________.
